# Overview
This demo show how to implement a continuous delivery pipeline supporting Oracle database changes (DDL) and database business logic (PL/SQL).

# Requirements
- A database connection where you are admin/sysdba (can create/drop users, and alter database with grant)
- Internet connection (required for gradle to be able to connect to maven central and download libs)
- JDK 1.8+ (current demo microservices are configured to compile with OpenJDK 11)
- gradle
- SQLcl version 21.3
- git

# Setting up the demo environment
## Download the sample
- Download ZIP repository, or
- Clone the github repository
## Download and uncompress the database connection wallet file
- Uncompress in your favourite place
- Recommended: Create a wallet folder in the project root and uncompress there (wallet/ is already in .gitignore file)
## Create your enviroment configuration file
- Edit the `scripts/.env_sample` file, and set
  - TNS_SERVICE as the name of your database service
  - ADMIN_PASSWORD with the password of your DBA.
  - Optional: ADMIN_USER with the name of your SYSDBA is different of ADMIN
  - Optional: TNS_ADMIN with the location of your wallet (if you decided to user your favourite folder)
  - Optional, not recommended: User and Paswords for the dev and pre users
- Rename the file to `.env`

  `mv ./scripts/.env_sample ./scripts/.env`
  
## Generate environments
- Disconnect the possible previous connection to your service
- Execute the initialization script
  `./scripts/initialize.sh`
- The script
  - will create 2 database users/schemas simulanting 2 DB environments (dev and pre). Also, will enable the EDITIONS feature for these users
  - will create a master git respository, simulating a git registry in folder `demo/environments/origin``
  - will create 2 folders to simulate 2 environments (development environment and pre-production environment)
- **WARNING**: If you use EDITIONS in your database for other tasks, notice that this script reset all EDITIONS to a new base edition called EDITION_MAIN
## Open your favourite development tools
- **Microservices testing**: Use your favorite tool for testing the microservices. If you use Postman, you can import the file `demo/postman/Springboot Sample App.postman_collection.json` for the endpoints, and the file `demo/postman/Local Spring Boot Application.postman_environment.json` for the environment (in this case, only for set the variable origin to http://localhost:7000)
- **PL/SQL Development**: In SQL developer create a connection as developer, to your service
- **Microservices development**: Import the Spring Boot project in your favourite java development tool. The project for the developer is located in demo/environments/dev (after running the initialization script). NOTE: Currently this sample has been create with Visual Studio Code for my personal comfort, but this is not (IMHO) the best tool for Spring development.

# Executing the demo
## Initial test of application
- Start your SQL developer and connect with the development user (demo_dev) to database
- Start Postman and select the `Spring Sample App` workspace
- Start your favourite terminal (I use the embedded terminal in VSCode) and move to development environment
  `cd environments/dev`. Start the SpringBoot application with `./app-run.sh``
- From Postman (or your favourite tool)
  - Check the application health using the `Actuator health` endpoint
  - Using the `Get All Products`, `Create Products`and `Get Product by id`feed some products to sample. Be aware that initially the product only have id and name (relevant for the JSON body in POST/Create and PUT/Update)
## Create and deploy the V1 for Canary testing (PL/SQL)
- Modify the simple test function using the SQL Developer. E.g. changing directly the greeting text in function `Greeting`
  ```
  create or replace FUNCTION Greeting RETURN VARCHAR2 AS
  BEGIN
    RETURN 'Hello, A BRAVE NEW world!!!';
  END;
  /
  ```
- Test the function in Postman (there is no need to restart application)
- As developer, you close and deliver a V1 version. For this, execute the script
  ```
  demo/scripts/dev-publish-version.sh v1
  ```
  **TODO**: The current version does not check if you deploy twice the same version tag, but it will fail later.
- Optional: Check the deployment

  - In development environment `./environments/dev` execute `git log`. You have to see the last commit (`HEAD -> dev`) tagged with `V1`, and synchronized with `origin/dev`
  ```
  commit 0ff68ece30303530708a05b1306891d848e97df3 (HEAD -> dev, tag: V1, origin/dev)  
  ```

  - Check de Liquibase generated scripts in `./environments/dev/database/liquibase`. Notice that the scripts contains the full schema definition.

- As operation, deploy the application for Canary testing. For this, execute the script

  ```
  demo/scripts/pre-deploy-version-in-test.sh v1
  ```

- Optional: Check the deployment in pre environment

  - In preproduction environment `./environments/pre` execute `git log`. You have to see the last commit (`HEAD -> dev`) tagged with `V1`, and synchronized with `origin/dev` and `origin/pre`
  ```
  commit 0ff68ece30303530708a05b1306891d848e97df3 (HEAD -> pre, tag: V1, origin/pre, origin/dev) 
  ```

  - Check de Liquibase generated log files in `./environments/dev/database/liquibase`. You can see the DDLs executed in the environment

  - In preproduction schema/database the content of the tables `DATABASECHANGELOG`(Liquibase native) and `DATABASECHANGELOG_ACTION`(SQLcl extension)


## Do Canary testing
- Ensure that dev application is stopped. Currently the both enviroments share the port 7000, so cannot coexist in the same PC
- Start your favourite terminal and move to preproduction environment `cd environments/pre`. Start the SpringBoot application with `./app-run.sh`
- In Postman, call the `Greeting` function. You will set the previous (v0) message `"greeting": "Hello, world!!!"` because by default all users are in B (previous) scenary
- Using Postman, use the `Procedure: Set Current Edition` to change your scenario to `EDITION_V1``
- Repeat the previous call to `Greeting` and you will get the V1 message `"greeting": "Hello, A BRAVE NEW world!!!"`
- NOTE: In real world scenarios, we can use several alternatives. In microservices we can create differente database services (pointing to the different editions) and have a pool of containers, some pointing to V0 services and the canary testers pointing to V1.

## Deploy for all users
- As operator, execute the deployment script. For this, execute the script

  ```
  demo/scripts/pre-deploy-version-for-all.sh
  ```
- In the current version, you have to restart the front-end application to see the changes. Stop the running application in pre environment, and re-run  with `./app-run.sh`
- Re-execute the same test done in Canary testing
  - Repeat the previous call to `Greeting` and you will get the V1 message `"greeting": "Hello, A BRAVE NEW world!!!"`
  - If you call the service `Get current edition`, you will see `EDITION_V1` with no need to change
- Alternatives: We can create different services using different editions with DBMS_SERVICE.CREATE_SERVICE. See [Oracle Database Administrator's Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/adfns&id=ADMIN12956)


## Create and deploy V2 for all users (DDL)
- Stop the running application in pre environment, and restart the application in dev
  ```
  cd ./demo/environments/dev
  ./app-run.sh
  ```
- Modify the java code for adding a isactive numeric field
  - Edit the file `./demo/environments/dev/application/src/main/java/com/example/application/persistence/ProductEntity.java`
  - Add the isactive field
    ```
    private int isactive;
    ```
  - Add the getter and setter
    ```
    public void setIsactive(int isActive) {
      this.isactive=isActive;
    }

    public int getIsactive() {
      return this.isactive;
    }
    ```
- In database DEV environment, modify the PRODUCT table to add ISACTIVE column
  ```
  ALTER TABLE "PRODUCT" ADD ("ISACTIVE" NUMBER(1,0) DEFAULT 1 NOT NULL ENABLE);
  ```
- In database DEV environment, modify the function ProductCount to consider new field
  ```
  CREATE OR REPLACE EDITIONABLE FUNCTION "PRODUCTCOUNT" RETURN NUMBER AS
    l_count NUMBER;
  BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    INTO l_count
    FROM Product
      WHERE ISACTIVE=1;

    RETURN l_count;
  END;
  ```
- Test the application
  - Notice the new field in GetAllProductos or GetProduct
  - Create a new product, adding "isactive": 0 to JSON
  ```
  {
    "name": "My first inactive product",
    "isactive": 0
  }
  ```
  - Check the function ProductCount

- Deploy the new version
  - Stop application in dev environment
  - Deploy
    ```
    demo/scripts/dev-publish-version.sh v2
    demo/scripts/pre-deploy-version-in-test.sh v2
    demo/scripts/pre-deploy-version-for-all.sh
    ```
  - Start application in pre environment and retest


## Rollback
- In case of error, you can rollback the last version deployed. For this, 
- Disconnect all users connected to the last versions. **TODO**: Implement automatic disconnection of these users
- Execute the script
  ```
  demo/scripts/pre-rollback-version.sh v2
  ```
- If you require to rollback several version, you have to execute the script n-times
- IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:
  - The rollback remove the structure changes (DDL) and the code changes (PL/SQL)
  - Also, removes the EDITION from the database
  - But, DO NOT REMOVE the tag from GIT. So, we suggest that the next version created in dev environment DO NOT REUSE the tag, to avoid possible collateral efects. NOTE: It's an standard recomendation do not remove commits or tags in git progression. If required, you have to change the scripts to do a rebase/cherry-picking in case of rollback and apply it to all environments. Again, we do not recommend
